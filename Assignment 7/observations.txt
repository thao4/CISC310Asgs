Assignment #7
April 30, 2024

Comparing this program with the program created for assignment #2, this was able to
produce consistent results and fixed the race condition issue caused by the threads
in assignment #2. Whenever one thread entered the critical section, it would check
to see if there is any work to do and if not, then it would immediately exit out
of the section. This lock guaranteed a specific result every time the program was
ran and made sure that both threads were operating correctly.

In total, I have spent roughly 2 hours on this assignment.
