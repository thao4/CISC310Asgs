The three different page-replacement methods each have different page faults
depending on the size of the frame and the page-reference string.
With very little page frames, all three methods almost have the same amount of
page faults. However, with larger frames and even larger page-reference strings,
The difference between the methods are more prevalent. The FIFO Algorithm
trends toward having larger page faults because it only gets rid of the
pages that come in first without regards to the potential pages later in the 
reference string. The LRU algorithm uses the recencies of the page uses and
produces sightly less page faults. It is a little bit better than the FIFO algorithm.
The optimal algorithm has the least page faults out of the three because it 
accounts for future pages that will be referenced again.

In total, I have spent roughly 5 hours on this assignments.
