Assignment #6
April 16, 2024

From this assignment, I learned the different types of disk scheduling algorithms 
and the positives and negatives of each. Algorithms like FCFS are easier to implement
because of its simplicity but makes too many head movement. Therefore, having additional
computations will decrease the total head movement. For example, SSTF had significantly
better total head movement because it tried to find the shortest request distance from the head.
However, this requires finding the next request, which when done with a large
data set, will lead to longer waiting and response time. It will also have to keep moving left
and right. SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, and CLOOK provide better waiting and response time, as well as
a better total head movement compared to FCFS. They start in one direction and process as many
requests as they can until they reach either the last request or the end of the disk. Then,
they go back and finish whatever request is left over.

In total, I have spent roughly 4 hours on this assignments.
